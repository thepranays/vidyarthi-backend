      #  # The config used here exposes port 29092 for _external_ connections to the broker
      # i.e. those from _outside_ the docker network. This could be from the host machine
      # running docker, or maybe further afield if you've got a more complicated setup.
      # If the latter is true, you will need to change the value 'localhost' in
      # KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS to one that is resolvable to the docker host from those
      # remote clients
      #
      # For connections _internal_ to the docker network, such as from other services
      # and components, use kafka:9092.
      #by default PLAINTEXT is HOST if there is PLAINTEXT INTERNAL , otherwise it will act as plaintext internal in presence of plaintext_host
